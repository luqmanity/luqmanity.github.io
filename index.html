            <h3>
                A brief introduction
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am a secondary school student aged 15 that enjoys
                coding, tech, and everything news, geopolitics and 
                finances. Born and raised in Malaysia, by questionable
                parents - a housewife and a tech CEO.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why is this so ugly?!
            </h3>
            <p>
                To be honest, I don't really like to do frontend development.
                I touch some HTML/CSS and some Next.js every once in a while
                but simply said, frontend is not really my thing.

                This website has no JavaScript lol, am lazy.
            </p>

        <!--Contacts, reach out-->
        <div>
            <h2>Reach me out</h2>
            <p>
                Like most, if not every other teenager out there, I have social media
                accounts that are public to share <b>things that deserve to be
                in the internet</b> (usually cool things :D)
            </p>
            <div class="social">
                <h3>GitHub</h3>
                <p>
                    Most of my projects from Q4 2023 and beyond are available on my
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/luqmanity">GitHub profile</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Instagram</h3>
                <p>
                    I have a decent following in Instagram,
                    check out my
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/luqmanity.exe">public account</a>!
                    Do note I rarely post things here, oftentimes just stories.
                </p>
                <h3>X (formerly Twitter)</h3>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, I am rarely on Twitter/X but I check things out every once in a while.
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/luqmanity_exe">Check it out</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Email me?</h3>
                <p>
                    I have several emails, but <a href="mailto:luqman.yazrie@outlook.com">but this is the one</a> I
                    check the most frequently.
