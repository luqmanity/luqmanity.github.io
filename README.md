# My Portfolio Website

It's my second attempt on HTML, CSS and JavaScript lol.
An attempt to create a portfolio website for myself.

It works? Sure

# What's coming?

All the new things I've learned related to web-dev will be applied
to this portfolio website. Made it public so everyone can have a look
and maybe learn a thing or two.

As I continue learning JavaScript with some HTML and CSS with it,
this repo will follow suit with the progress.
